POST request at login page for SQL injection payload

This code sends a POST request to a login page with a SQL injection payload injected into the username field. If the response contains the word "error," it indicates that the application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Of course, this is a very basic example and real-world vulnerability tests can be much more complex and involve a variety of different techniques and payloads.
